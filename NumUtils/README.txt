README for NumUtil project

1)Note for adding debugging printouts. I have set up the print out for debugging by define a conditional compilation symbol.

	#if DEBUG
		Console.Write.............
	#endif

	the symbol "DEBUG" is defined in the project property page under "build" tab.


	To disable this, simply remove this "DEBUG" or change it to other symbol
